As far as we know, the elves in Asgard should be able to help us, if we give them the required Resources. We should check out, what they have to offer",
  "botanicpledge.page.world_ash_branch": "It seems we need to acquire wood from Yggdrasil, but the elves only trade in their branches. Hopefully these branches are already enough for our uses! \n \n Alternatively the branches can be collected by applying 'Yggdrasil Debarking Bounty' onto an axe",
