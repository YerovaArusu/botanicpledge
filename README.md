# Botanic Pledge

This is an addon for the wellknown Botania mod:

- It has 4 protectors of different tiers.

1. Mana Protector
   Weak... very weak

2. Terra Protector
   Weak... but better than the first one

3. Gaia Protector
   Already very good... but there is still a lot to improve

4. Yggdral Protector
   So far the best one.

- and more:

+ Yggdral Scepter: Not yet craftable... but very soon
+ The Core Altar: A new unqiue way of Crafting and Upgrading or Altering certain Items.
+ Vedrfolnir's Core: A new Type of Upgradable Curio. Capable of Surpassing the protectors:
    - These Cores aim to create a method to counter even the most powerful armors in the entire Minecraft modding community... the Draconic Armor...

What have I planned?

- more weapons & Armor
- more blocks
- more funtionality for the Yggdral Scepter
- magic Damage attribute for every weapon.
- a new Boss called Marina Arusu (If you're wondering... yes she is from DAL)

The Protectors are inspired by another mod:
