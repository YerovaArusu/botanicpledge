This is an Addon for the wellknown Botania mod:

- It 4 Protectors of diefferent Tiers.

1. Mana Protector
   Weak... very weak

2. Terra Protector
   Weak... but better than the first one

3. Gaia Protector
   Already very good... but there is still a lot to improve

4. Yggdral Protector
   So far the best one.

- and more:

+ Yggdral Scepter not yet Craftable... but very soon
+ The Core Altar(A new unqiue way of Crafting and Upgrading or Altering certain Items).
+ Divine Core Items(Marias and Marinas Core): A new Type of Upgradable Curio. Capable of Surpassing thw protectos):
    - These Cores aim to create a method to counter even the most Powerful Armors in the entire Minecraft Modpack
      Community... the draconic Armor...

What have I planned?

- more weapons & Armor
- more blocks
- more funtionality for Yggdral Sceptar
- magic Damage attribute for every weapon.
- a new Boss called Marina Arusu(If you are wondering... yes she is from DAL)

The Protectors are inspired from another Mod:
