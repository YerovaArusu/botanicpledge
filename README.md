This is an Addon for the wellknown Botania mod:


It 4 Protectors of diefferent Tiers.

1. Mana Protector
    Weak... very weak
   
2. Terra Protector
    Weak... but better than the first one
    
3. Gaia Protector
    Already very good... but there is still a lot to improve
    
4. Yggdral Protector
    So far the best one.

and one Weapon...

- Yggdral Scepter not yet Craftable... but very soon



What have I planned?
- more weapons & Armor
- more blocks
- more funtionality for Yggdral Sceptar
- magic Damage
- a new Boss called Yggdrasils Guardian





The Protectors are inspired from another Mod:
